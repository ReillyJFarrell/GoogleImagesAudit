# GoogleImagesAudit



Our project took a few pivots throughout the course of the class. From the start we had wanted to look further into the world of representation on image query services. At first we felt that it would be interesting to see how the representation study we looked at in regard to Google could be replicated on DuckDuckGo, the reason being that DuckDuckGo advertises itself as "-an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results-"(DuckDuckGo Website, 2022). We wanted to see if the service could back up its reputation, but eventually we somewhat lost interests in this project because it felt like it was not enough.

By the good graces of Prof. Sapiezynski and some help from Avijit we latched onto the idea of looking at representation of nationalities, permutated in terms of gender, on Google Images. This idea was a bit more open ended but there were some general ideas in terms of the harms and/or weird stuff going on. Were some nationalities perceived more negatively than others? Were the perceptions of men and women different in different regions? We wanted to gather the data and take a look around, and try to find some things that merit discussion. As such we frame this whole study as more exploratory, rather than something like the Markup's study were they were gunning to see if Amazon was biasing with its own products.
